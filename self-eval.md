# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? I feel like with a group i was able to rely on everyone while still adding my own ideas so i think i faced these challenges well.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? It is still a bit rough but it is getting better by the day.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? Honestly i want to remember almost everything i learnd about O,O,P  so that i can use it effectivly in the future
